# Machine-Learning-Algorithms

Author: Zimeng Qiu, zimengq@andrew.cmu.edu

Written classical machine learning algorithms from scratch.

This repository stores my code for CMU course [18-661 Introduction to Machine Learning for Engineers](https://18661.github.io), taught by Virginia Smith and Carlee Joe-Wong.

Classcial machine learning algorithms implemented:

- Ridge Regression

- Batch Gradient Descent for Logistic Regression

- Linear SVM (soft margin)
